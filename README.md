basex-idml
==========

Proof of concept for using BaseX to manipulate IDML through a web interface.

Server Setup
============

I am running this on MacOS. Other OS is an exercise for the user. 

```
# install BaseX
brew install basex
# start server
basexserver
```
This is using the default port 1984 and admin/admin as credentials.
